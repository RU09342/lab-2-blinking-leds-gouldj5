## Procedure


# Description
Blinks LED with 50% duty cycle (time off = time on)
250000us
The simple blink procedure for this lab required little to no change across processors and luckily was easily configured with each board's LED1 port. The blinking was done in a while loop toggling after a certain value. 

#Extra Work

On the G2553, the blink was set up to morse code to transmit SOS. UART morse code transfer is being investigated for future lab.
