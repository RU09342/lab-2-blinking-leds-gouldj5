## Dependencies
* MSP430G2553 Development board
* CCS coding software
* Proper power being supplied to the processor
* Proper Reset Circuitry 
* Proper Bypass and Bulk Capacitors as needed
* Breadboard
* LED of any color
* Wires

## Set Requirements
"Now that we have the whole blinking LED out of the way, why don't we try making things a little more convenient by taking the G2553 off the development board and into a breadboard. In addition to the software, your README needs to also contain a picture of your circuit with at least 2 LEDs blinking all on a breadboard an without a development board. 
Please be advised that you can easily damage or destroy one of the pins on the MSP430 by applying the wrong voltage or attempting to draw too much current from it. Really check your design before you power up to ensure you do not need request another processor."

#### Tasks
* [x] Use the G2553 with an off-board circuit
* [x] Blink two LED's with the G2553
* [ ] Extra Work

## Compatibility
* MSP430G2553

# Functionality Description
Blink 2 LEDs off from the development board using the G2553 IC chip
### Detailed Description

* Similar to simple-blink code from this lab
